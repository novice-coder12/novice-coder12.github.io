<p>It's been since two weeks that the session had begun.And,we are going to have our first Guest Lecture by Van Lindberg on 23rd July at IRC channel #dgplug only.Just to give a brief insight,Van is going to bring a unique background to our session, being both a technologist and a lawyer. He currently serves as the Python Software Foundation's chairman, and he's Vice President of Intellectual Property at Rackspace. In 2008,he authored Intellectual Property and Open Source: A Practical Guide to Protecting Code, and in 2010-11,he served as the chairman of the Atlanta PyCons.</p>

<p>Looking forward to this great session ahead.</p>
